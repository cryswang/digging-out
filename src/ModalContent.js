            <p>First, make a simple budget to identify how much money can go to debt paydown. Check into money-saving strategies to free up a bit more cash.</p>
            <p>If any of your debt is "toxic," (payday loans, credit cards with high APRs), attack that first. </p>
            <p>You may be able to reduce how much goes to interest by refinancing some debts to a lower rate, or consolidating credit card debt.</p>    
            <p>Once you know how much you can funnel to your debts, pick a payoff order that will keep you motivated, whether that's the debt
             snowball (pay off debts from smallest to largest) or debt avalanche (knock off the highest-interest-rate debt first). </p>
